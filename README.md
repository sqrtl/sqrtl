# Hey, I'm Tyler 👋

Code tinkerer. Anime philosopher. White hat Hacker. Currently scheming my way to a digital nomad's life.

I automate boring stuff, break things in prod (then fix them), and occasionally build DeFi platforms at 3 AM during hackathons. Also write some anime psychology because who doesn't love listening to a nerd rant about something meaninglisly interesting.

## what I'm into lately

- 🔐 IAM/security (making auth systems that don't suck)
- ⛓️ Web3 experiments (DeFi, smart contracts, decentralized identity)
- 🎮 Gaming and understanding why we're all addicted
- 📝 Writing anime philosophy pieces (yes, really)
- 🌎 Planning my digital nomad arc

## Stuff I've built

**[ABLEfid](https://github.com/your-friends-repo/ABLEfid)** - ETHGlobal Hackathon 2025  
Decentralized fiduciary platform built in 36 hours with 3 other caffeine-addicted devs. Smart contracts, token swapping, the whole deal. Traditional finance has competition now.

**Duo Provisioning Automation** - Montclair State  
Turned a painful 4-step manual process into "it works well" automation.  JS that saves people hours of their lives.

**Security Automation Scripts** - Montclair State
Wrote some Bash Scripts that save Security Engineers hours of work with simplified workflow.

## Background stuff

**B.S. Information Technology** - Pace University  
Used to teach AWS & full-stack
Speak English, Spanish, Portuguese (Brasil here I come)

---

## currently

- Learning GCP (because why not add another cloud)
- Getting better at Solidity without breaking things
- Trying to build in public without overthinking it
- **Open to remote work** - especially if it means I can travel more.

## when I'm not coding

Writing anime philosophy (Attack on Titan is basically Nietzsche, fight me) • gaming • consuming unreasonable amounts of anime • thinking about that YouTube channel I'll definitely start someday
